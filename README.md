# 凄六 - sugoroku -

This game is a sugoroku-style challenge where numerous enemies advance by rolling dice. Your objective is to use cards to create a board that delays the enemies as long as possible. The enemies have different dice depending on their type. Hover over for information on enemy health and count. Clear the stage by ensuring fewer enemies reach the goal than the stage's target. After setting up the board, simulate the result. Use the cards wisely to slow down the enemies and achieve victory. Good luck!
